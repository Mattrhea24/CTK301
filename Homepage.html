                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Creative Technologies major at ISU. I have always had a passion for creatively expressing ideas and making art through video and sound. This site contains all of my projects I have created within the last year and will continue to grow as I progress through my career. I grew up in Bloomington, IL and have also resided in Texas/California. Throughout my early years of life I experimented with different creative outlooks and have video editing to be my passion. As a growing editor find new ways to express myself through different topics of media. Whether it's a basketball mix, mental awareness video, or running through the evolution of dance. These examples lead to all different creative outputs and lets display my persoanlity without saying a word. Thank you for visiting my site! I hope you enjoy the content!  </p>
